# Perceiving Permissions

## Changing File Ownership - Challenge 1
**Flag:** `pwn.college{g-8gX3iOLETV-1AOGG-MNr5CvwR.QXxEjN0wyMwkjNzEzW}  `

The process of obtaining the flag involved using `chown` to change the owner of a file.

```
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ chown hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{g-8gX3iOLETV-1AOGG-MNr5CvwR.QXxEjN0wyMwkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned how to use `chown` to change the owner of a file. Here is changed the owner to hacker.

## References
None

## Groups and Files - Challenge 2
**Flag:** `pwn.college{4O6iXjaysJdzi9yNL5yA28frLlV.QXxcjM1wyMwkjNzEzW}`

The process of obtaining the flag involved using `chgrp` to change the group of a file.

```
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ chgrp hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{4O6iXjaysJdzi9yNL5yA28frLlV.QXxcjM1wyMwkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned how to use `chgrp` to change the group ownership of a file. Linux has various types of group ownerships. by this command i changed the file   's group to hacker which is a group I am in.

## Fun With Group Names - Challenge 3
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EF3CUbVVh3TYHQnQRxJlXa5FkBW.QXycjM1wyMwkjNzEzW}`

The process of obtaining the flag involved listing and understanding group names and their permissions.

```
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ id
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(grp24360) groups=1000(grp24360)
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ chgrp grp24360 /flag
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{EF3CUbVVh3TYHQnQRxJlXa5FkBW.QXycjM1wyMwkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned how to list and interpret group names for the current user. I used id command to indentify the correct random group name

## References

## Changing Permissions - Challenge 4
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YJe8G_8_mZryBXhTLrktQw7LLb_.QXzcjM1wyMwkjNzEzW}`

The process of obtaining the flag involved using `chmod` to change file permissions.

```
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ chmod o+r /flag
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{YJe8G_8_mZryBXhTLrktQw7LLb_.QXzcjM1wyMwkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned how to use `chmod` to set file permissions. I also learnt about the options of chmod which are u+r, as above, adds read access to the user's permissions
g+wx adds write and execute access to the group's permissions
o-w removes write access for other users
a-rwx removes all permissions for the user, group, and world

## References

## Executable Files - Challenge 5
**Flag:** `pwn.college{seV9hslzBB9fd2f9KFpK1iZLkI4.QXyEjN0wyMwkjNzEzW}`

The process of obtaining the flag involved making a file executable using `chmod +x`.

```
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod o+x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
bash: /challenge/run: Permission denied
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod o+x /challenge
chmod: changing permissions of '/challenge': Operation not permitted
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ ls -l /challenge/run
-r--r--r-x 1 hacker hacker 32 Jan 14  2025 /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$  /challenge/run
bash: /challenge/run: Permission denied
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ cp /challenge/run /tmp/run_copy
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod +x /tmp/run_copy
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /tmp/run_copy
You MUST invoke me via /challenge/run to solve this challenge.
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod a+x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
Successful execution! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{seV9hslzBB9fd2f9KFpK1iZLkI4.QXyEjN0wyMwkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned how to make files executable with `chmod a+x`. I also learned that since Im the fileâ€™s owner, I needed to set the owner execute bit `(a+x)`, not just give execute to others (o+x), because Linux checks owner permissions first.

## The SUID Bit - Challenge 8
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QYgpltRP8h8LwhE_d-tFhvshkGS.QXzEjN0wyMwkjNzEzW}`

The process of obtaining the flag involved setting the SUID bit on a file using `chmod u+s`.

```
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ chmod u+s /challenge/getroot
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ /challenge/getroot
SUCCESS! You have set the suid bit on this program, and it is running as root!
Here is your shell...
root@permissions~the-suid-bit:~# cat /flag
pwn.college{QYgpltRP8h8LwhE_d-tFhvshkGS.QXzEjN0wyMwkjNzEzW}
root@permissions~the-suid-bit:~#
```

## What I Learned
I learned about the SUID bit and its effect on file execution privileges. By using chmod u+s on a program owned by root, I was able to execute it and gain a root shell
